The first official release on ibc-go was v1.0.0. v1.0.0 was decided to be used instead of v0.1.0 primarily for the following reasons: Maintaining compatibility with the IBC specification v1 requires stronger support/guarantees. Using the major, minor, and patch numbers allows for easier communication of what breaking changes are included in a release. The IBC module is being used by numerous high value projects which require stability.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/","h":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/#context","p":1062},{"i":1070,"t":"Go module version must be incremented​ When a Go module is released under v1.0.0, all following releases must follow Go semantic versioning. Thus when the go API is broken, the Go module major version must be incremented. For example, changing the go package version from v2 to v3 bumps the import from github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2 to github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3. If the Go module version is not incremented then attempting to go get a module @v3.0.0 without the suffix results in: invalid version: module contains a go.mod file, so major version must be compatible: should be v0 or v1, not v3 Version validation was added in Go 1.13. This means that in order to release a v3.0.0 git tag without a /v3 suffix on the module definition, the tag must explicitly not contain a go.mod file. Not including a go.mod in our release is not a viable option. Attempting to import multiple go module versions for ibc-go​ Attempting to import two versions of ibc-go, such as github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2 and github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3, will result in multiple issues. The Cosmos SDK does global registration of error and governance proposal types. The errors and proposals used in ibc-go would need to now register their naming based on the go module version. The more concerning problem is that protobuf definitions will also reach a namespace collision. ibc-go and the Cosmos SDK in general rely heavily on using extended functions for go structs generated from protobuf definitions. This requires the go structs to be defined in the same package as the extended functions. Thus, bumping the import versioning causes the protobuf definitions to be generated in two places (in v2 and v3). When registering these types at compile time, the go compiler will panic. The generated types need to be registered against the proto codec, but there exist two definitions for the same name. The protobuf conflict policy can be overridden via the environment variable GOLANG_PROTOBUF_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT, but it is possible this could lead to various runtime errors or unexpected behaviour (see here).

Changing the protobuf version would solve the namespace collision which arise from importing multiple versions of ibc-go, but it leads to new issues. In the Cosmos SDK, Anys are unpacked and decoded using the type URL. Changing the type URL thus is creating a distinctly different type. The same registration on the proto codec cannot be used to unpack the new type. For example: All Cosmos SDK messages are packed into Anys. If we incremented the protobuf version for our IBC messages, clients which submitted the v1 of our Cosmos SDK messages would now be rejected since the old type is not registered on the codec. The clients must know to submit the v2 of these messages. This pushes the burden of versioning onto relayers and wallets. A more serious problem is that the ClientState and ConsensusState are packed as Anys. Changing the protobuf versioning of these types would break compatibility with IBC specification v1. Moving protobuf definitions to their own go module​ The protobuf definitions could be moved to their own go module which uses 0.x versioning and will never go to 1.0. This prevents the Go module version from being incremented with breaking changes. It also requires all extended functions to live in the same Go module, disrupting the existing code structure. The version that implements this change will still be incompatible with previous versions, but future versions could be imported together without namespace collisions. For example, let's say this solution is implemented in v3.

Releases should focus on keeping backwards compatibility for go code clients, within reason. Old functionality should be marked as deprecated and there should exist upgrade paths between major versions. Deprecated functionality may be removed when no clients rely on that functionality.

At the time of this writing, the next major release of the SDK will change the format for constructing the transaction response data. v0.45 format​ The current version, v0.45 constructs the transaction response as follows: proto.Marshal(&sdk.TxMsgData{ Data: []*sdk.MsgData{msgResponses...}, } Where msgResponses is a slice of *sdk.MsgData. The MsgData.MsgType contains the sdk.MsgTypeURL of the sdk.Msg being executed. The MsgData.Data contains the proto marshaled MsgResponse for the associated message executed. Next major version format​ The next major version will construct the transaction response as follows: proto.Marshal(&sdk.TxMsgData{ MsgResponses: []*codectypes.Any{msgResponses...}, } Where msgResponses is a slice of the MsgResponses packed into Anys. Forwards compatible approach​ A forwards compatible approach was deemed infeasible. The handler provided by the MsgServiceRouter will only include the *sdk.Result and an error (if one occurred). In v0.45 of the SDK, the *sdk.Result.Data will contain the MsgResponse marshaled data. However, the MsgResponse is not packed and marshaled as a *codectypes.Any, thus making it impossible from a generalized point of view to unmarshal the bytes. If the bytes could be unmarshaled, then they could be packed into an *codectypes.Any in anticipation of the upcoming format. Intercepting the MsgResponse before it becomes marshaled requires replicating this code. It may not even be possible to replicate the linked code. The method handler would need to be accessed somehow. For these reasons it is deemed infeasible to attempt a forwards compatible approach. ICA auth developers can interpret which format was used when constructing the transaction response by checking if the sdk.TxMsgData.Data field is non-empty. If the sdk.TxMsgData.Data field is not empty then the format for v0.45 was used, otherwise ICA auth developers can assume the transaction response uses the newer format.

The coins are transferred to an escrow address (i.e locked) on the sender chain and then transferred to the receiving chain through IBC TAO logic. It is expected that the receiving chain will mint vouchers to the receiving address. Sender chain is acting as the sink zone. The coins (vouchers) are burned on the sender chain and then transferred to the receiving chain through IBC TAO logic. It is expected that the receiving chain, which had previously sent the original denomination, will unescrow the fungible token and send it to the receiving address. Another way of thinking of source and sink zones is through the token's timeline. Each send to any chain other than the one it was previously received from is a movement forwards in the token's timeline. This causes trace to be added to the token's history and the destination port and destination channel to be prefixed to the denomination. In these instances the sender chain is acting as the source zone. When the token is sent back to the chain it previously received from, the prefix is removed. This is a backwards movement in the token's timeline and the sender chain is acting as the sink zone.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/","h":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/#context","p":1102},{"i":1110,"t":"Assume the following channel connections exist and that all channels use the port ID transfer: chain A has channels with chain B and chain C with the IDs channelToB and channelToC, respectively chain B has channels with chain A and chain C with the IDs channelToA and channelToC, respectively chain C has channels with chain A and chain B with the IDs channelToA and channelToB, respectively These steps of transfer between chains occur in the following order: A -> B -> C -> A -> C. In particular: A -> B: sender chain is source zone. A sends packet with denom (escrowed on A), B receives denom and mints and sends voucher transfer/channelToA/denom to recipient. B -> C: sender chain is source zone. B sends packet with transfer/channelToA/denom (escrowed on B), C receives transfer/channelToA/denom and mints and sends voucher transfer/channelToB/transfer/channelToA/denom to recipient.

In this context, upon a receive of a cross-chain fungible token transfer, if the sender chain is the source of the token, the protocol prefixes the denomination with the port and channel identifiers in the following format: prefix + denom = {destPortN}/{destChannelN}/.../{destPort0}/{destChannel0}/denom Example: transferring 100 uatom from port HubPort and channel HubChannel on the Hub to Ethermint's port EthermintPort and channel EthermintChannel results in 100 EthermintPort/EthermintChannel/uatom, where EthermintPort/EthermintChannel/uatom is the new denomination on the receiving chain.

This poses a problem because, while port and channel identifiers have a maximum length of 64 each, the SDK Coin type only accepts denoms up to 64 characters. Thus, a single cross-chain token, which again, is composed by the port and channels identifiers plus the base denomination, can exceed the length validation for the SDK Coins. This can result in undesired behaviours such as tokens not being able to be transferred to multiple sink chains if the denomination exceeds the length or unexpected panics due to denomination validation failing on the receiving chain. The existence of special characters and uppercase letters on the denomination: In the SDK every time a Coin is initialized through the constructor function NewCoin, a validation of a coin's denom is performed according to a Regex, where only lowercase alphanumeric characters are accepted.

Some IBC relayers depend on the consensus_height attribute emitted as part of UpdateClient events in order to run 07-tendermint misbehaviour detection by cross-checking the details of the Header emitted at a given consensus height against those of the Header from the originating chain. This includes such details as: The SignedHeader containing the commitment root. The ValidatorSet that signed the Header. The TrustedHeight seen by the client at less than or equal to the height of Header. The last TrustedValidatorSet at the trusted height. Following the refactor of the 02-client submodule and associated ClientState interfaces, it will now be possible for light client implementations to perform such actions as batch updates, inserting N number of ConsensusStates into the application state tree with a single UpdateClient message. This flexibility is provided in ibc-go by the usage of the Protobuf Any field contained within the UpdateClient message. For example, a batched client update message serialized as a Protobuf Any type for the 07-tendermint lightclient implementation could be defined as follows: message BatchedHeaders { repeated Header headers = 1; } To complement this flexibility, the UpdateClient handler will now support the submission of client misbehaviour by consolidating the Header and Misbehaviour interfaces into a single ClientMessage interface type: // ClientMessage is an interface used to update an IBC client. // The update may be done by a single header, a batch of headers, misbehaviour, or any type which when verified produces // a change to state of the IBC client type ClientMessage interface { proto.Message ClientType() string ValidateBasic() error } To support this functionality the GetHeight() method has been omitted from the new ClientMessage interface. Emission of standardised events from the 02-client submodule now becomes problematic and is two-fold: The 02-client submodule previously depended upon the GetHeight() method of Header types in order to retrieve the updated consensus height.

While, this change was positive in development, increasing the flexibility and adoptability of IBC, it also opened the door to new problems. The difficulty of generalizing light clients became apparent once changes to those light clients were required.

To work around the lack of support for non-zero height upgrades, an abstract height type was created along with an upgrade mechanism.

Currently there exists two different approaches to callbacks being invoked by core IBC. IBC light clients currently are invoked by a ClientState and ConsensusState interface as defined by core IBC. The 02-client submodule will retrieve the ClientState or ConsensusState from the IBC store in order to perform callbacks to the light client. This design requires all required information for the light client to function to be stored in the ClientState or ConsensusState or potentially under metadata keys for a specific client instance. Additional information may be provided by core IBC via the defined interface arguments if that information is generic enough to be useful to all IBC light clients. This constraint has proved problematic as pass through clients (such as wasm) cannot maintain easy access to a VM instance. In addition, without increasing the size of the defined ClientState interface, light clients are unable to take advantage of basic built-in SDK functionality such as genesis import/export and migrations. The other approach used to perform callback logic is via registered SDK modules. This approach is used by core IBC to interact with IBC applications. IBC applications will register their callbacks on the IBC router at compile time. When a packet comes in, core IBC will use the IBC router to lookup the registered callback functions for the provided packet. The benefit of registered callbacks opposed to interface functions is that additional information may be accessed via external keepers. Because the IBC applications are also SDK modules, they additionally get access to a host of functionality provided by the SDK. This includes: genesis import/export, migrations, query/transaction CLI commands, type registration, gRPC query registration, and message server registration.

The tendermint and solo machine clients were refactored to include this AppModuleBasic implementation and core IBC will no longer include either type as registered by default. Longer term solutions include using internal module communication as described in ADR 033 on the SDK. The following functions should become callbacks invoked via intermodule communication: Status GetTimestampAtHeight VerifyMembership VerifyNonMembership Initialize VerifyClientMessage CheckForMisbehaviour UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour UpdateState CheckSubstituteAndUpdateState VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState The ClientState interface should eventually be trimmed down to something along the lines of: type ClientState interface { proto.Message ClientType() string GetLatestHeight() Height Validate() error ZeroCustomFields() ClientState // ADDITION Route() string // route used for intermodule communication } For the most part, any functions which require access to the client store should likely not be an interface function of the ClientState.

This setup worked well for off-chain users interacting with IBC applications. We are now seeing the desire for secondary applications (e.g. smart contracts, modules) to call into IBC apps as part of their state machine logic and then do some actions on the basis of the packet result. Or to receive a packet from IBC and do some logic upon receipt. Example Usecases: Send an ICS-20 packet, and if it is successful, then send an ICA-packet to swap tokens on LP and return funds to sender Execute some logic upon receipt of token transfer to a smart contract address This requires a second layer of callbacks.

The ExecutionGasLimit is the practical limit of the tx execution that is set in the context gas meter. It is the minimum of the CommitGasLimit and the gas left in the context gas meter which is determined by the relayer's choice of tx gas limit.

Require Tendermint light clients (ICS 07) to expose the following additional state mutation functions Unfreeze(), which unfreezes a light client after misbehaviour and clears any frozen height previously set Add a new governance proposal with MsgRecoverClient. Create a new Msg with two client identifiers (string) and a signer. The first client identifier is the proposed client to be updated. This client must be either frozen or expired. The second client is a substitute client. It carries all the state for the client which may be updated. It must have identical client and chain parameters to the client which may be updated (except for latest height, frozen height, and chain-id). It should be continually updated during the voting period. If this governance proposal passes, the client on trial will be updated to the latest state of the substitute. The signer must be the authority set for the ibc module. Previously, AllowUpdateAfterExpiry and AllowUpdateAfterMisbehaviour were used to signal the recovery options for an expired or frozen client, and governance proposals were not allowed to overwrite the client if these parameters were set to false. However, this has now been deprecated because a code migration can overwrite the client and consensus states regardless of the value of these parameters. If governance would vote to overwrite a client or consensus state, it is likely that governance would also be willing to perform a code migration to do the same. In addition, TrustingPeriod was initially not allowed to be updated by a client upgrade proposal. However, due to the number of situations experienced in production where the TrustingPeriod of a client should be allowed to be updated because of ie: initial misconfiguration for a canonical channel, governance should be allowed to update this client parameter. In versions older than ibc-go v8, MsgRecoverClient was a governance proposal type ClientUpdateProposal. It has been removed and replaced by MsgRecoverClient in the migration from governance v1beta1 to governance v1. Note that this should NOT be lightly updated, as there may be a gap in time between when misbehaviour has occurred and when the evidence of misbehaviour is submitted. For example, if the UnbondingPeriod is 2 weeks and the TrustingPeriod has also been set to two weeks, a validator could wait until right before UnbondingPeriod finishes, submit false information, then unbond and exit without being slashed for misbehaviour. Therefore, we recommend that the trusting period for the 07-tendermint client be set to 2/3 of the UnbondingPeriod. Note that clients frozen due to misbehaviour must wait for the evidence to expire to avoid becoming refrozen. This ADR does not address planned upgrades, which are handled separately as per the specification.","s":"Decision","u":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/","h":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/#decision","p":1323},{"i":1339,"t":"Establishes a mechanism for client recovery in the case of expiry Establishes a mechanism for client recovery in the case of misbehaviour Constructing an ClientUpdate Proposal is as difficult as creating a new client","s":"Positive","u":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/","h":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/#positive","p":1323},{"i":1341,"t":"Additional complexity in client creation which must be understood by the user Coping state of the substitute adds complexity Governance participants must vote on a substitute client","s":"Negative","u":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/","h":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/#negative","p":1323},{"i":1343,"t":"No neutral consequences.","s":"Neutral","u":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/","h":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/#neutral","p":1323},{"i":1345,"t":"Prior discussion Epoch number discussion Upgrade plan discussion Migration from gov v1beta1 to gov v1","s":"References","u":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/","h":"/architecture/adr-026-ibc-client-recovery-mechanisms/#references","p":1323},{"i":1348,"t":"2021-04-23: Change status to \"deprecated\" 2020-05-23: Provide sample Go code and more details 2020-05-18: Initial Draft","s":"Changelog","u":"/architecture/adr-025-ibc-passive-channels/","h":"/architecture/adr-025-ibc-passive-channels/#changelog","p":1346},{"i":1350,"t":"deprecated","s":"Status","u":"/architecture/adr-025-ibc-passive-channels/","h":"/architecture/adr-025-ibc-passive-channels/#status","p":1346},{"i":1352,"t":"The current \"naive\" IBC Relayer strategy currently establishes a single predetermined IBC channel atop a single connection between two clients (each potentially of a different chain). This strategy then detects packets to be relayed by watching for send_packet and recv_packet events matching that channel, and sends the necessary transactions to relay those packets. We wish to expand this \"naive\" strategy to a \"passive\" one which detects and relays both channel handshake messages and packets on a given connection, without the need to know each channel in advance of relaying it. In order to accomplish this, we propose adding more comprehensive events to expose channel metadata for each transaction sent from the x/ibc/core/04-channel/keeper/handshake.go and x/ibc/core/04-channel/keeper/packet.go modules. Here is an example of what would be in ChanOpenInit: const ( EventTypeChannelMeta = \"channel_meta\" AttributeKeyAction = \"action\" AttributeKeyHops = \"hops\" AttributeKeyOrder = \"order\" AttributeKeySrcPort = \"src_port\" AttributeKeySrcChannel = \"src_channel\" AttributeKeySrcVersion = \"src_version\" AttributeKeyDstPort = \"dst_port\" AttributeKeyDstChannel = \"dst_channel\" AttributeKeyDstVersion = \"dst_version\" ) // ... // Emit Event with Channel metadata for the relayer to pick up and // relay to the other chain // This appears immediately before the successful return statement. ctx.EventManager().EmitEvents(sdk.Events{ sdk.NewEvent( types.EventTypeChannelMeta, sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyAction, \"open_init\"), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcConnection, connectionHops[0]), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyHops, strings.Join(connectionHops, \",\")), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyOrder, order.String()), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcPort, portID), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcChannel, channelID), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcVersion, version), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstPort, counterparty.GetPortID()), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstChannel, counterparty.GetChannelID()), // The destination version is not yet known, but a value is necessary to pad // the event attribute offsets sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstVersion, \"\"), ), }) These metadata events capture all the \"header\" information needed to route IBC channel handshake transactions without requiring the client to query any data except that of the connection ID that it is willing to relay.

To implement this behavior, we propose replacing the cbs.OnChanOpenTry callback with a new cbs.OnAttemptChanOpenTry callback which explicitly handles the MsgChannelOpenTry, usually by resulting in a call to keeper.ChanOpenTry. The typical implementation, in x/ibc-transfer/module.go would be compatible with the current \"naive\" relayer, as follows: func (am AppModule) OnAttemptChanOpenTry( ctx sdk.Context, chanKeeper channel.Keeper, portCap *capability.Capability, msg channel.MsgChannelOpenTry, ) (*sdk.Result, error) { // Require portID is the portID transfer module is bound to boundPort := am.keeper.GetPort(ctx) if boundPort != msg.PortID { return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(porttypes.ErrInvalidPort, \"invalid port: %s, expected %s\", msg.PortID, boundPort) } // BEGIN NEW CODE // Assert our protocol version, overriding the relayer's suggestion. msg.Version = types.Version // Continue the ChanOpenTry. res, chanCap, err := channel.HandleMsgChannelOpenTry(ctx, chanKeeper, portCap, msg) if err != nil { return nil, err } // END OF NEW CODE // ... the rest of the callback is similar to the existing OnChanOpenTry // but uses msg.* directly.

Generally, routing module callbacks have two separate steps in them, verification and execution. This corresponds to the AnteHandler-Handler model inside the SDK. We can do the verification inside the AnteHandler in order to increase developer ergonomics by reducing boilerplate verification code. For atomic multi-message transaction, we want to keep the IBC related state modification to be preserved even the application side state change reverts. One of the example might be IBC token sending message following with stake delegation which uses the tokens received by the previous packet message. If the token receiving fails for any reason, we might not want to keep executing the transaction, but we also don't want to abort the transaction or the sequence and commitment will be reverted and the channel will be stuck.

DeleteCommitment will delete the commitment stored, DeleteCommitmentTimeout will delete the commitment and close channel in case of ordered channel. func (keeper ChannelKeeper) WriteAcknowledgement(ctx Context, packet Packet, ack []byte) { keeper.SetPacketAcknowledgement(ctx, packet.GetDestPort(), packet.GetDestChannel(), packet.GetSequence(), ack) keeper.SetNextSequenceRecv(ctx, packet.GetDestPort(), packet.GetDestChannel(), packet.GetSequence()) } func (keeper ChannelKeeper) DeleteCommitment(ctx Context, packet Packet) { keeper.deletePacketCommitment(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetSequence()) } func (keeper ChannelKeeper) DeleteCommitmentTimeout(ctx Context, packet Packet) { k.deletePacketCommitment(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetSequence()) if channel.Ordering == types.ORDERED [ channel.State = types.CLOSED k.SetChannel(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), channel) } } Each application handler should call respective finalization methods on the PortKeeper in order to increase sequence (in case of packet) or remove the commitment (in case of acknowledgement and timeout). Calling those functions implies that the application logic has successfully executed. However, the handlers can return Result with CodeTxBreak after calling those methods which will persist the state changes that has been already done but prevent any further messages to be executed in case of semantically invalid packet. This will keep the sequence increased in the previous IBC packets(thus preventing double execution) without proceeding to the following messages. In any case the application modules should never return state reverting result, which will make the channel unable to proceed. ChannelKeeper.CheckOpen method will be introduced. This will replace onChanOpen* defined under the routing module specification. Instead of define each channel handshake callback functions, application modules can provide ChannelChecker function with the AppModule which will be injected to ChannelKeeper.Port() at the top level application. CheckOpen will find the correct ChannelChecker using the PortID and call it, which will return an error if it is unacceptable by the application. The ProofVerificationDecorator will be inserted to the top level application. It is not safe to make each module responsible to call proof verification logic, whereas application can misbehave(in terms of IBC protocol) by mistake. The ProofVerificationDecorator should come right after the default sybil attack resistant layer from the current auth.NewAnteHandler: // add IBC ProofVerificationDecorator to the Chain of func NewAnteHandler( ak keeper.AccountKeeper, supplyKeeper types.SupplyKeeper, ibcKeeper ibc.Keeper, sigGasConsumer SignatureVerificationGasConsumer) sdk.AnteHandler { return sdk.ChainAnteDecorators( NewSetUpContextDecorator(), // outermost AnteDecorator. SetUpContext must be called first ... NewIncrementSequenceDecorator(ak), ibcante.ProofVerificationDecorator(ibcKeeper.ClientKeeper, ibcKeeper.ChannelKeeper), // innermost AnteDecorator ) } The implementation of this ADR will also create a Data field of the Packet of type []byte, which can be deserialised by the receiving module into its own private type. It is up to the application modules to do this according to their own interpretation, not by the IBC keeper. This is crucial for dynamic IBC. Example application-side usage: type AppModule struct {} // CheckChannel will be provided to the ChannelKeeper as ChannelKeeper.Port(module.CheckChannel) func (module AppModule) CheckChannel(portID, channelID string, channel Channel) error { if channel.Ordering != UNORDERED { return ErrUncompatibleOrdering() } if channel.CounterpartyPort != \"bank\" { return ErrUncompatiblePort() } if channel.Version != \"\" { return ErrUncompatibleVersion() } return nil } func NewHandler(k Keeper) Handler { return func(ctx Context, msg Msg) Result { switch msg := msg.(type) { case MsgTransfer: return handleMsgTransfer(ctx, k, msg) case ibc.MsgPacket: var data PacketDataTransfer if err := types.ModuleCodec.UnmarshalBinaryBare(msg.GetData(), &data); err != nil { return err } return handlePacketDataTransfer(ctx, k, msg, data) case ibc.MsgTimeoutPacket: var data PacketDataTransfer if err := types.ModuleCodec.UnmarshalBinaryBare(msg.GetData(), &data); err != nil { return err } return handleTimeoutPacketDataTransfer(ctx, k, packet) // interface { PortID() string; ChannelID() string; Channel() ibc.Channel } // MsgChanInit, MsgChanTry implements ibc.MsgChannelOpen case ibc.MsgChannelOpen: return handleMsgChannelOpen(ctx, k, msg) } } } func handleMsgTransfer(ctx Context, k Keeper, msg MsgTransfer) Result { err := k.SendTransfer(ctx,msg.PortID, msg.ChannelID, msg.Amount, msg.Sender, msg.Receiver) if err != nil { return sdk.ResultFromError(err) } return sdk.Result{} } func handlePacketDataTransfer(ctx Context, k Keeper, packet Packet, data PacketDataTransfer) Result { err := k.ReceiveTransfer(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetDestinationPort(), packet.GetDestinationChannel(), data) if err != nil { // TODO: Source chain sent invalid packet, shutdown channel } k.ChannelKeeper.WriteAcknowledgement([]byte{0x00}) // WriteAcknowledgement increases the sequence, preventing double spending return sdk.Result{} } func handleCustomTimeoutPacket(ctx Context, k Keeper, packet CustomPacket) Result { err := k.RecoverTransfer(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetDestinationPort(), packet.GetDestinationChannel(), data) if err != nil { // This chain sent invalid packet or cannot recover the funds panic(err) } k.ChannelKeeper.DeleteCommitmentTimeout(ctx, packet) // packet timeout should not fail return sdk.Result{} } func handleMsgChannelOpen(sdk.Context, k Keeper, msg MsgOpenChannel) Result { k.AllocateEscrowAddress(ctx, msg.ChannelID()) return sdk.Result{} }","s":"Decision","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#decision","p":1366},{"i":1374,"t":"Proposed","s":"Status","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#status","p":1366},{"i":1377,"t":"Intuitive interface for developers - IBC handlers do not need to care about IBC authentication State change commitment logic is embedded into baseapp.runTx logic","s":"Positive","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#positive","p":1366},{"i":1379,"t":"Cannot support dynamic ports, routing is tied to the baseapp router","s":"Negative","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#negative","p":1366},{"i":1381,"t":"Introduces new AnteHandler decorator.

Adding support for new light clients or updating an existing light client in the event of a security issue or consensus update is a multi-step process which is both time-consuming and error-prone. In order to enable new IBC light client implementations it is necessary to modify the codebase of ibc-go (if the light client is part of its codebase), re-build chains' binaries, pass a governance proposal and validators upgrade their nodes. Another problem stemming from the above process is that if a chain wants to upgrade its own consensus, it will need to convince every chain or hub connected to it to upgrade its light client in order to stay connected. Due to the time-consuming process required to upgrade a light client, a chain with lots of connections needs to be disconnected for quite some time after upgrading its consensus, which can be very expensive in terms of time and effort. We are proposing simplifying this workflow by integrating a Wasm light client module that makes adding support for new light clients a simple governance-gated transaction. The light client bytecode, written in Wasm-compilable Rust, runs inside a Wasm VM. The Wasm light client submodule exposes a proxy light client interface that routes incoming messages to the appropriate handler function, inside the Wasm VM for execution. With the Wasm light client module, anybody can add new IBC light client in the form of Wasm bytecode (provided they are able to submit the governance proposal transaction and that it passes) as well as instantiate clients using any created client type.

The application layer builds on top of the transport layer and defines exactly how data packets should be packaged and interpreted by the sending and receiving chains. IBC provides a reliable, permissionless, and generic base layer (allowing for the secure relaying of data packets), while allowing for composability and modularity with separation of concerns by moving application designs (interpreting and acting upon the packet data) to a higher-level layer. This separation is reflected in the categories: IBC/TAO comprises the Transport, Authentication, and Ordering of packets, i.e. the infrastructure layer. IBC/APP consists of the application handlers for the data packets being passed over the transport layer. These include but are not limited to fungible token transfers (ICS-20), NFT transfers (ICS-721), and interchain accounts (ICS-27). Application module: groups any application, middleware or smart contract that may wrap downstream application handlers to provide enhanced functionality. Note three crucial elements in the diagram: The chains depend on relayers to communicate. Relayers are the \"physical\" connection layer of IBC: off-chain processes responsible for relaying data between two chains running the IBC protocol by scanning the state of each chain, constructing appropriate datagrams, and executing them on the opposite chain as is allowed by the protocol. Many relayers can serve one or more channels to send messages between the chains.

When using ORDERED channels, the order of transactions when sending packets from a controller to a host chain is maintained. When using UNORDERED channels, there is no guarantee that the order of transactions when sending packets from the controller to the host chain is maintained. If no ordering is specified in MsgRegisterInterchainAccount, then the default ordering for new ICA channels is UNORDERED. A limitation when using ORDERED channels is that when a packet times out the channel will be closed. In the case of a channel closing, a controller chain needs to be able to regain access to the interchain account registered on this channel. Active Channels enable this functionality. When an Interchain Account is registered using MsgRegisterInterchainAccount, a new channel is created on a particular port. During the OnChanOpenAck and OnChanOpenConfirm steps (on controller & host chain respectively) the Active Channel for this interchain account is stored in state. It is possible to create a new channel using the same controller chain portID if the previously set Active Channel is now in a CLOSED state. This channel creation can be initialized programmatically by sending a new MsgChannelOpenInit message like so: msg := channeltypes.NewMsgChannelOpenInit(portID, string(versionBytes), channeltypes.ORDERED, []string{connectionID}, icatypes.HostPortID, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(icatypes.ModuleName).String()) handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) res, err := handler(ctx, msg) if err != nil { return err } Alternatively, any relayer operator may initiate a new channel handshake for this interchain account once the previously set Active Channel is in a CLOSED state. This is done by initiating the channel handshake on the controller chain using the same portID associated with the interchain account in question. It is important to note that once a channel has been opened for a given interchain account, new channels can not be opened for this account until the currently set Active Channel is set to CLOSED.","s":"Understanding Active Channels","u":"/v10/apps/interchain-accounts/active-channels/","h":"","p":1458},{"i":1461,"t":"Future versions of the ICS-27 protocol and the Interchain Accounts module will likely use a new channel type that provides ordering of packets without the channel closing in the event of a packet timing out, thus removing the need for Active Channels entirely.

The controller submodule is used for account registration and packet sending. It executes only logic required of all controllers of interchain accounts. The type of authentication used to manage the interchain accounts remains unspecified. There may exist many different types of authentication which are desirable for different use cases. Thus the purpose of the authentication module is to wrap the controller submodule with custom authentication logic. In ibc-go, authentication modules can communicate with the controller submodule by passing messages through baseapp's MsgServiceRouter. To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface need not be fulfilled; it is only required to fulfill Cosmos SDK's AppModuleBasic interface, just like any regular Cosmos SDK application module.

Synopsis Authentication modules play the role of the Base Application as described in ICS-30 IBC Middleware, and enable application developers to perform custom logic when working with the Interchain Accounts controller API. The controller submodule is used for account registration and packet sending. It executes only logic required of all controllers of interchain accounts. The type of authentication used to manage the interchain accounts remains unspecified. There may exist many different types of authentication which are desirable for different use cases. Thus the purpose of the authentication module is to wrap the controller submodule with custom authentication logic. In ibc-go, authentication modules are connected to the controller chain via a middleware stack. The controller submodule is implemented as middleware and the authentication module is connected to the controller submodule as the base application of the middleware stack. To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface must be fulfilled. By implementing the controller submodule as middleware, any amount of authentication modules can be created and connected to the controller submodule without writing redundant code. The authentication module must: Authenticate interchain account owners. Track the associated interchain account address for an owner. Send packets on behalf of an owner (after authentication).","s":"Deprecation Notice","u":"/v10/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/","h":"/v10/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/#deprecation-notice","p":1511},{"i":1515,"t":"The following IBCModule callbacks must be implemented with appropriate custom logic: // OnChanOpenInit implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenInit( ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID string, channelID string, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, version string, ) (string, error) { // perform custom logic return version, nil } // OnChanOpenAck implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenAck( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, counterpartyVersion string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnChanCloseConfirm implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanCloseConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnAcknowledgementPacket implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, acknowledgement []byte, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnTimeoutPacket implements the IBCModule interface. func (im IBCModule) OnTimeoutPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } The following functions must be defined to fulfill the IBCModule interface, but they will never be called by the controller submodule so they may error or panic.

It contains a sequence of port and channel identifiers ordered from the most recent to the oldest in the timeline of transfers. tip When using transfer with IBC v2 connecting to e.g. Ethereum, the source channel identifier will be the source client identifier instead. This information is included on the token's base denomination field in the form of a hash to prevent an unbounded denomination length. For example, the token transfer/channelToA/uatom will be displayed as ibc/7F1D3FCF4AE79E1554D670D1AD949A9BA4E4A3C76C63093E17E446A46061A7A2.

You may display the human readable denominations by querying balances with the --resolve-denom flag, as in: simd query bank balances [address] --resolve-denom Each send to any chain other than the one it was previously received from is a movement forwards in the token's timeline. This causes trace to be added to the token's history and the destination port and destination channel to be prefixed to the denomination. In these instances the sender chain is acting as the \"source zone\". When the token is sent back to the chain it previously received from, the prefix is removed. This is a backwards movement in the token's timeline and the sender chain is acting as the \"sink zone\".

A general pseudo algorithm would look like the following: Query the full denomination trace. Query the channel with the portID/channelID pair, which corresponds to the first destination of the token. Query the client state using the identifiers pair. Note that this query will return a \"Not Found\" response if the current chain is not connected to this channel.

The IBC protocol doesn't know the topology of the overall network (i.e connections between chains and identifier names between them). For this reason, in the multiple hops case, a particular chain in the timeline of the individual transfers can't query the chain and client identifiers of the other chains. Take for example the following sequence of transfers A -> B -> C for an IBC token, with a final prefix path (trace info) of transfer/channelChainC/transfer/channelChainB. What the paragraph above means is that even in the case that chain C is directly connected to chain A, querying the port and channel identifiers that chain B uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelChainA) can be completely different from the one that chain C uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelToChainA). Thus the proposed solution for clients that the IBC team recommends are the following: Connect to all chains: Connecting to all the chains in the timeline would allow clients to perform the queries outlined in the direct connection section to each relevant chain. By repeatedly following the port and channel denomination trace transfer timeline, clients should always be able to find all the relevant identifiers. This comes at the tradeoff that the client must connect to nodes on each of the chains in order to perform the queries. Relayer as a Service (RaaS): A longer term solution is to use/create a relayer service that could map the denomination trace to the chain path timeline for each token (i.e origin chain -> chain #1 -> ... -> chain #(n-1) -> final chain). These services could provide merkle proofs in order to allow clients to optionally verify the path timeline correctness for themselves by running light clients. If the proofs are not verified, they should be considered as trusted third parties services. Additionally, client would be advised in the future to use RaaS that support the largest number of connections between chains in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, none of the existing public relayers (in Golang and Rust), provide this service to clients. tip The only viable alternative for clients (at the time of writing) to tokens with multiple connection hops, is to connect to all chains directly and perform relevant queries to each of them in the sequence.","s":"Multiple hops","u":"/v10/apps/transfer/ics20-v1/overview/","h":"/v10/apps/transfer/ics20-v1/overview/#multiple-hops","p":1594},{"i":1610,"t":"In some exceptional cases, a client state associated with a given channel cannot be updated.

Once the proposal passes the client state will be unfrozen and the funds from the associated channels will then be unlocked. This mechanism only applies to clients that allow updates via governance, such as Tendermint clients. In addition to this, it's important to mention that a token must be sent back along the exact route that it took originally in order to return it to its original form on the source chain (eg: the Cosmos Hub for the uatom).

Here are the channel handshake callbacks that modules are expected to implement: // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenInit func (k Keeper) OnChanOpenInit(ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID string, channelID string, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, version string, ) error { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake // Examples: Abort if order == UNORDERED, // Abort if version is unsupported err := checkArguments(args) return err } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenTry OnChanOpenTry( ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID, channelID string, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, counterpartyVersion string, ) (string, error) { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake if err := checkArguments(args); err != nil { return err } // Construct application version // IBC applications must return the appropriate application version // This can be a simple string or it can be a complex version constructed // from the counterpartyVersion and other arguments. // The version returned will be the channel version used for both channel ends. appVersion := negotiateAppVersion(counterpartyVersion, args) return appVersion, nil } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenAck OnChanOpenAck( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, counterpartyVersion string, ) error { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenConfirm OnChanOpenConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } The channel closing handshake will also invoke module callbacks that can return errors to abort the closing handshake. Closing a channel is a 2-step handshake, the initiating chain calls ChanCloseInit and the finalizing chain calls ChanCloseConfirm. // Called by IBC Handler on MsgCloseInit OnChanCloseInit( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom finalization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgCloseConfirm OnChanCloseConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom finalization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } Channel Handshake Version Negotiation​ Application modules are expected to verify versioning used during the channel handshake procedure. ChanOpenInit callback should verify that the MsgChanOpenInit.Version is valid ChanOpenTry callback should construct the application version used for both channel ends. If no application version can be constructed, it must return an error. ChanOpenAck callback should verify that the MsgChanOpenAck.CounterpartyVersion is valid and supported. IBC expects application modules to perform application version negotiation in OnChanOpenTry. The negotiated version must be returned to core IBC. If the version cannot be negotiated, an error should be returned. Versions must be strings but can implement any versioning structure. If your application plans to have linear releases then semantic versioning is recommended. If your application plans to release various features in between major releases then it is advised to use the same versioning scheme as IBC. This versioning scheme specifies a version identifier and compatible feature set with that identifier. Valid version selection includes selecting a compatible version identifier with a subset of features supported by your application for that version. The struct is used for this scheme can be found in 03-connection/types. Since the version type is a string, applications have the ability to do simple version verification via string matching or they can use the already implemented versioning system and pass the proto encoded version into each handhshake call as necessary. ICS20 currently implements basic string matching with a single supported version.","s":"Implement IBCModule Interface and callbacks","u":"/v10/ibc/apps/apps/","h":"/v10/ibc/apps/apps/#implement-ibcmodule-interface-and-callbacks","p":1634},{"i":1642,"t":"Modules connected by a channel must agree on what application data they are sending over the channel, as well as how they will encode/decode it. This process is not specified by IBC as it is up to each application module to determine how to implement this agreement. However, for most applications this will happen as a version negotiation during the channel handshake. While more complex version negotiation is possible to implement inside the channel opening handshake, a very simple version negotiation is implemented in the ibc-transfer module. Thus, a module must define its custom packet data structure, along with a well-defined way to encode and decode it to and from []byte. // Custom packet data defined in application module type CustomPacketData struct { // Custom fields ... } EncodePacketData(packetData CustomPacketData) []byte { // encode packetData to bytes } DecodePacketData(encoded []byte) (CustomPacketData) { // decode from bytes to packet data } Then a module must encode its packet data before sending it through IBC. // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) packet.Data = data // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) A module receiving a packet must decode the PacketData into a structure it expects so that it can act on it. // Receiving custom application packet data (in OnRecvPacket) packetData := DecodePacketData(packet.Data) // handle received custom packet data Packet Flow Handling​ Just as IBC expected modules to implement callbacks for channel handshakes, IBC also expects modules to implement callbacks for handling the packet flow through a channel. Once a module A and module B are connected to each other, relayers can start relaying packets and acknowledgements back and forth on the channel. Briefly, a successful packet flow works as follows: module A sends a packet through the IBC module the packet is received by module B if module B writes an acknowledgement of the packet then module A will process the acknowledgement if the packet is not successfully received before the timeout, then module A processes the packet's timeout. Sending Packets​ Modules do not send packets through callbacks, since the modules initiate the action of sending packets to the IBC module, as opposed to other parts of the packet flow where msgs sent to the IBC module must trigger execution on the port-bound module through the use of callbacks. Thus, to send a packet a module simply needs to call SendPacket on the IBCChannelKeeper. // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) Receiving Packets​ To handle receiving packets, the module must implement the OnRecvPacket callback. This gets invoked by the IBC module after the packet has been proved valid and correctly processed by the IBC keepers. Thus, the OnRecvPacket callback only needs to worry about making the appropriate state changes given the packet data without worrying about whether the packet is valid or not. Modules may return to the IBC handler an acknowledgement which implements the Acknowledgement interface. The IBC handler will then commit this acknowledgement of the packet so that a relayer may relay the acknowledgement back to the sender module. The state changes that occurred during this callback will only be written if: the acknowledgement was successful as indicated by the Success() function of the acknowledgement if the acknowledgement returned is nil indicating that an asynchronous process is occurring NOTE: Applications which process asynchronous acknowledgements must handle reverting state changes when appropriate. Any state changes that occurred during the OnRecvPacket callback will be written for asynchronous acknowledgements. OnRecvPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, ) ibcexported.Acknowledgement { // Decode the packet data packetData := DecodePacketData(packet.Data) // do application state changes based on packet data and return the acknowledgement // NOTE: The acknowledgement will indicate to the IBC handler if the application // state changes should be written via the `Success()` function. Application state // changes are only written if the acknowledgement is successful or the acknowledgement // returned is nil indicating that an asynchronous acknowledgement will occur. ack := processPacket(ctx, packet, packetData) return ack } The Acknowledgement interface: // Acknowledgement defines the interface used to return // acknowledgements in the OnRecvPacket callback. type Acknowledgement interface { Success() bool Acknowledgement() []byte }","s":"Custom Packets","u":"/v10/ibc/apps/apps/","h":"/v10/ibc/apps/apps/#custom-packets","p":1634},{"i":1644,"t":"Modules may commit an acknowledgement upon receiving and processing a packet in the case of synchronous packet processing. In the case where a packet is processed at some later point after the packet has been received (asynchronous execution), the acknowledgement will be written once the packet has been processed by the application which may be well after the packet receipt. NOTE: Most blockchain modules will want to use the synchronous execution model in which the module processes and writes the acknowledgement for a packet as soon as it has been received from the IBC module. This acknowledgement can then be relayed back to the original sender chain, which can take action depending on the contents of the acknowledgement. Just as packet data was opaque to IBC, acknowledgements are similarly opaque. Modules must pass and receive acknowledegments with the IBC modules as byte strings. Thus, modules must agree on how to encode/decode acknowledgements. The process of creating an acknowledgement struct along with encoding and decoding it, is very similar to the packet data example above. ICS 04 specifies a recommended format for acknowledgements. This acknowledgement type can be imported from channel types. While modules may choose arbitrary acknowledgement structs, a default acknowledgement types is provided by IBC here: // Acknowledgement is the recommended acknowledgement format to be used by // app-specific protocols. // NOTE: The field numbers 21 and 22 were explicitly chosen to avoid accidental // conflicts with other protobuf message formats used for acknowledgements. // The first byte of any message with this format will be the non-ASCII values // `0xaa` (result) or `0xb2` (error). Implemented as defined by ICS: // https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#acknowledgement-envelope message Acknowledgement { // response contains either a result or an error and must be non-empty oneof response { bytes result = 21; string error = 22; } } Acknowledging Packets​ After a module writes an acknowledgement, a relayer can relay back the acknowledgement to the sender module. The sender module can then process the acknowledgement using the OnAcknowledgementPacket callback. The contents of the acknowledgement is entirely up to the modules on the channel (just like the packet data); however, it may often contain information on whether the packet was successfully processed along with some additional data that could be useful for remediation if the packet processing failed. Since the modules are responsible for agreeing on an encoding/decoding standard for packet data and acknowledgements, IBC will pass in the acknowledgements as []byte to this callback. The callback is responsible for decoding the acknowledgement and processing it. OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, acknowledgement []byte, ) (*sdk.Result, error) { // Decode acknowledgement ack := DecodeAcknowledgement(acknowledgement) // process ack res, err := processAck(ack) return res, err } Timeout Packets​ If the timeout for a packet is reached before the packet is successfully received or the counterparty channel end is closed before the packet is successfully received, then the receiving chain can no longer process it. Thus, the sending chain must process the timeout using OnTimeoutPacket to handle this situation. Again the IBC module will verify that the timeout is indeed valid, so our module only needs to implement the state machine logic for what to do once a timeout is reached and the packet can no longer be received.

This acknowledgement can then be relayed back to the original sender chain, which can take action depending on the contents of the acknowledgement. Just as packet data was opaque to IBC, acknowledgements are similarly opaque. Modules must pass and receive acknowledegments with the IBC modules as byte strings. Thus, modules must agree on how to encode/decode acknowledgements. The process of creating an acknowledgement struct along with encoding and decoding it, is very similar to the packet data example above. ICS 04 specifies a recommended format for acknowledgements. This acknowledgement type can be imported from channel types. While modules may choose arbitrary acknowledgement structs, a default acknowledgement types is provided by IBC here: // Acknowledgement is the recommended acknowledgement format to be used by // app-specific protocols. // NOTE: The field numbers 21 and 22 were explicitly chosen to avoid accidental // conflicts with other protobuf message formats used for acknowledgements. // The first byte of any message with this format will be the non-ASCII values // `0xaa` (result) or `0xb2` (error). Implemented as defined by ICS: // https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#acknowledgement-envelope message Acknowledgement { // response contains either a result or an error and must be non-empty oneof response { bytes result = 21; string error = 22; } }","s":"Acknowledgements","u":"/v10/ibc/apps/packets_acks/","h":"/v10/ibc/apps/packets_acks/#acknowledgements","p":1677},{"i":1688,"t":"Synopsis Learn how to implement IBC v2 applications To build an IBC v2 application the following steps are required: Implement the IBCModule interface Bind Ports Implement the IBCModule Keeper Implement application payload and success acknowledgement Set and Seal the IBC Router Highlighted improvements for app developers with IBC v2: No need to support channel handshake callbacks Flexibility on upgrading application versioning, no need to use channel upgradability to renegotiate an application version, simply support the application version on both sides of the connection.

With IBC v2, modules are not directly connected. Instead a pair of clients are connected and register the counterparty clientID. Packets are routed to the relevant application module by the portID registered in the Router. Relayers send packets between the routers/packet handlers on each chain. Briefly, a successful packet flow works as follows: A user sends a message to the IBC packet handler The IBC packet handler validates the message, creates the packet and stores the commitment and returns the packet sequence number. The Payload, which contains application specific data, is routed to the relevant application. If the counterparty writes an acknowledgement of the packet then the sending chain will process the acknowledgement. If the packet is not successfully received before the timeout, then the sending chain processes the packet's timeout. Sending packets​ MsgSendPacket is sent by a user to the channel v2 message server, which calls ChannelKeeperV2.SendPacket. This validates the message, creates the packet, stores the commitment and returns the packet sequence number. The application must specify its own payload which is used by the application and sent with MsgSendPacket. An application developer needs to implement the custom logic the application executes when a packet is sent. // OnSendPacket logic func (im *IBCModule) OnSendPacket( ctx sdk.Context, sourceChannel string, destinationChannel string, sequence uint64, payload channeltypesv2.Payload, signer sdk.AccAddress) error { // implement any validation // implement payload decoding and validation // call the relevant keeper method for state changes as a result of application logic // emit events or telemetry data return nil } Receiving packets​ To handle receiving packets, the module must implement the OnRecvPacket callback. An application module should validate and confirm support for the given version and encoding method used as there is greater flexibility in IBC v2 to support a range of versions and encoding methods. The OnRecvPacket callback is invoked by the IBC module after the packet has been proven to be valid and correctly processed by the IBC keepers. Thus, the OnRecvPacket callback only needs to worry about making the appropriate state changes given the packet data without worrying about whether the packet is valid or not. Modules may return to the IBC handler an acknowledgement which implements the Acknowledgement interface. The IBC handler will then commit this acknowledgement of the packet so that a relayer may relay the acknowledgement back to the sender module. The state changes that occurr during this callback could be: the packet processing was successful as indicated by the PacketStatus_Success and an Acknowledgement() will be written if the packet processing was unsuccessful as indicated by the PacketStatus_Failure and an ackErr will be written Note that with IBC v2 the error acknowledgements are standardised and cannot be customised. func (im IBCModule) OnRecvPacket( ctx sdk.Context, sourceChannel string, destinationChannel string, sequence uint64, payload channeltypesv2.Payload, relayer sdk.AccAddress) channeltypesv2.RecvPacketResult { // do application state changes based on payload and return the result // state changes should be written via the `RecvPacketResult` return recvResult } Acknowledging packets​ After a module writes an acknowledgement, a relayer can relay back the acknowledgement to the sender module. The sender module can then process the acknowledgement using the OnAcknowledgementPacket callback. The contents of the acknowledgement is entirely up to the application developer. IBC will pass in the acknowledgements as []byte to this callback. The callback is responsible for decoding the acknowledgement and processing it. The acknowledgement is serialised and deserialised using JSON. func (im IBCModule) OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, sourceChannel string, destinationChannel string, sequence uint64, acknowledgement []byte, payload channeltypesv2.Payload, relayer sdk.AccAddress) error { // check the type of the acknowledgement // if not ackErr, unmarshal the JSON acknowledgement and unmarshal packet payload // perform any application specific logic for processing acknowledgement // emit events return nil } Timeout packets​ If the timeout for a packet is reached before the packet is successfully received or the receiving chain can no longer process the packet the sending chain must process the timeout using OnTimeoutPacket. Again the IBC module will verify that the timeout is valid, so our module only needs to implement the state machine logic for what to do once a timeout is reached and the packet can no longer be received. func (im IBCModule) OnTimeoutPacket( ctx sdk.Context, sourceChannel string, destinationChannel string, sequence uint64, payload channeltypesv2.Payload, relayer sdk.AccAddress) error { // unmarshal packet data // do custom timeout logic, e.g. refund tokens for transfer } PacketDataUnmarshaler​ The PacketDataUnmarshaler interface is required for IBC v2 applications to implement because the encoding type is specified by the Payload and multiple encoding types are supported. type PacketDataUnmarshaler interface { // UnmarshalPacketData unmarshals the packet data into a concrete type // the payload is provided and the packet data interface is returned UnmarshalPacketData(payload channeltypesv2.Payload) (interface{}, error) }","s":"Packet callbacks","u":"/v10/ibc/apps/ibcv2apps/","h":"/v10/ibc/apps/ibcv2apps/#packet-callbacks","p":1687},{"i":1694,"t":"Currently, ports must be bound on app initialization.

The Tendermint client is the first and most deployed light client in IBC. It implements the IBC light client module interface to track a counterparty running CometBFT consensus. note Tendermint is the old name of CometBFT which has been retained in IBC to avoid expensive migration costs. The Tendermint client consists of two important structs that keep track of the state of the counterparty chain and allow for future updates. The ClientState struct contains all the parameters necessary for CometBFT header verification. The ConsensusState, on the other hand, is a compressed view of a particular header of the counterparty chain. Unlike off chain light clients, IBC does not store full header. Instead it stores only the information it needs to prove verification of key/value pairs in the counterparty state (i.e. the header AppHash), and the information necessary to use the consensus state as the next root of trust to add a new consensus state to the client (i.e. the header NextValidatorsHash and Timestamp). The relayer provides the full trusted header on UpdateClient, which will get checked against the compressed root-of-trust consensus state. If the trusted header matches a previous consensus state, and the trusted header and new header pass the CometBFT light client update algorithm, then the new header is compressed into a consensus state and added to the IBC client. Each Tendermint Client is composed of a single ClientState keyed on the client ID, and multiple consensus states which are keyed on both the clientID and header height. Relayers can use the consensus states to verify merkle proofs of packet commitments, acknowledgements, and receipts against the AppHash of the counterparty chain in order to enable verified packet flow. If a counterparty chain violates the CometBFT protocol in a way that is detectable to off-chain light clients, this misbehaviour can also be submitted to an IBC client by any off-chain actor. Upon verification of this misbehaviour, the Tendermint IBC Client will freeze, preventing any further packet flow from this malicious chain from occurring. Governance or some other out-of-band protocol may then be used to unwind any damage that has already occurred.","s":"Overview","u":"/v10/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/#overview","p":1853},{"i":1857,"t":"The Tendermint light client is initialized with a ClientState that contains parameters necessary for CometBFT header verification along with a latest height and ConsensusState that encapsulates the application state root of a trusted header that will serve to verify future incoming headers from the counterparty. message ClientState { // human readable chain-id that will be included in header // and signed over by the validator set string chain_id = 1; // trust level is the fraction of the trusted validator set // that must sign over a new untrusted header before it is accepted // it can be a minimum of 1/3 and a maximum of 2/3 // Note these are the bounds of liveness. 1/3 is the minimum // honest stake needed to maintain liveness on a chain, // requiring more than 2/3 to sign over the new header would // break the BFT threshold of allowing 1/3 malicious validators Fraction trust_level = 2; // duration of the period since the LatestTimestamp during which the // submitted headers are valid for update google.protobuf.Duration trusting_period = 3; // duration of the staking unbonding period google.protobuf.Duration unbonding_period = 4; // defines how much new (untrusted) header's Time can drift // into the future relative to our local clock. google.protobuf.Duration max_clock_drift = 5; // Block height when the client was frozen due to a misbehaviour ibc.core.client.v1.Height frozen_height = 6; // Latest height the client was updated to ibc.core.client.v1.Height latest_height = 7; // Proof specifications used in verifying counterparty state repeated cosmos.ics23.v1.ProofSpec proof_specs = 8; // Path at which next upgraded client will be committed. // Each element corresponds to the key for a single CommitmentProof in the // chained proof.

In case the malicious subset of the validators exceeds the trust level of the client, then the client can be deceived into accepting invalid blocks and the connection is no longer secure. The Tendermint client has some mitigations in place to prevent this. If there are two valid blocks signed by the counterparty validator set at the same height [e.g. a valid block signed by an honest subset and an invalid block signed by a malicious one], then these conflicting headers can be submitted to the client as misbehaviour. The client will verify the headers and freeze the client; preventing any future updates and proof verification from succeeding. This effectively halts communication with the compromised counterparty while out-of-band social consensus can unwind any damage done. Similarly, if the timestamps of the headers are not monotonically increasing, this can also be evidence of malicious behaviour and cause the client to freeze.

This means that the safety property of bilateral IBC communication between two chains is dependent on the safety properties of the two chains in question.

For example, if a malicious validator set has taken over more than 2/3 of the validator power on a chain; that malicious validator set can create a single chain of blocks with arbitrary commitment roots and arbitrary commitments to the next validator set. This would seize complete control of the chain and prevent the honest subset from even being able to create a competing honest block. In this case, there is no ability for the IBC Tendermint client solely tracking CometBFT consensus to detect the misbehaviour and freeze the client. The IBC protocol would require out-of-band mechanisms to detect and fix such an egregious safety fault on the counterparty chain. Since the Tendermint light client is only tracking consensus and not also verifying the validity of state transitions, malicious behaviour from a validator set that is beyond the BFT fault threshold is an accepted risk of this light client implementation. The IBC protocol has principles of fault isolation (e.g. all tokens are prefixed by their channel, so tokens from different chains are not mutually fungible) and fault mitigation (e.g. ability to freeze the client if misbehaviour can be detected before complete malicious takeover) that make this risk as minimal as possible.","s":"Security model","u":"/v10/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/#security-model","p":1853},{"i":1867,"t":"It is vital that high-value IBC clients can upgrade along with their underlying chains to avoid disruption to the IBC ecosystem.

As an example, in wasmd this is set to the wasm folder under the home directory. In the code snippet below we set this field to the ibc_08-wasm_client_data folder under the home directory. SupportedCapabilities is a list of capabilities supported by the chain. wasmd sets this to all the available capabilities, but 08-wasm only requires iterator. MemoryCacheSize sets the size in MiB of an in-memory cache for e.g. module caching.

Currently the only option available is the WithQueryPlugins option, which allows registration of custom query plugins for the 08-wasm module. The use of this API is optional and it is only required if the chain wants to register custom query plugins for the 08-wasm module. WithQueryPlugins​ By default, the 08-wasm module does not configure any querier options for light client contracts. However, it is possible to register custom query plugins for QueryRequest::Custom and QueryRequest::Stargate. Assuming that the keeper is not yet instantiated, the following sample code shows how to register query plugins for the 08-wasm module. We first construct a QueryPlugins object with the desired query plugins: queryPlugins := ibcwasmtypes.QueryPlugins { Custom: MyCustomQueryPlugin(), // `myAcceptList` is a `[]string` containing the list of gRPC query paths that the chain wants to allow for the `08-wasm` module to query. // These queries must be registered in the chain's gRPC query router, be deterministic, and track their gas usage. // The `AcceptListStargateQuerier` function will return a query plugin that will only allow queries for the paths in the `myAcceptList`. // The query responses are encoded in protobuf unlike the implementation in `x/wasm`. Stargate: ibcwasmtypes.AcceptListStargateQuerier(myAcceptList), } Note that the Stargate querier appends the user defined accept list of query routes to a default list defined by the 08-wasm module. The defaultAcceptList defines a single query route: \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\". This allows for light client smart contracts to delegate parts of their workflow to other light clients for auxiliary proof verification. For example, proof of inclusion of block and tx data by a data availability provider. // defaultAcceptList defines a set of default allowed queries made available to the Querier. var defaultAcceptList = []string{ \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\", } You may leave any of the fields in the QueryPlugins object as nil if you do not want to register a query plugin for that query type. Then, we pass the QueryPlugins object to the WithQueryPlugins option: querierOption := ibcwasmkeeper.WithQueryPlugins(&queryPlugins) Finally, we pass the option to the NewKeeperWithConfig or NewKeeperWithVM constructor function during Keeper instantiation: app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithConfig( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmConfig, app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, ) app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithVM( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmer, // pass the Wasm VM instance to `08-wasm` keeper constructor app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, )","s":"Options","u":"/v10/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/","h":"/v10/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/#options","p":1991},{"i":2006,"t":"If the chain's 02-client submodule parameter AllowedClients contains the single wildcard \"*\" element, then it is not necessary to do anything in order to allow the creation of 08-wasm clients.

A client can be associated with any number of connections to the counterparty chain. The client identifier is auto generated using the client type and the global client counter appended in the format: {client-type}-{N}. A ClientState should contain chain specific and light client specific information necessary for verifying updates and upgrades to the IBC client. The ClientState may contain information such as chain ID, latest height, proof specs, unbonding periods or the status of the light client. The ClientState should not contain information that is specific to a given block at a certain height, this is the function of the ConsensusState. Each ConsensusState should be associated with a unique block and should be referenced using a height. IBC clients are given a client identifier prefixed store to store their associated client state and consensus states along with any metadata associated with the consensus states. Consensus states are stored using their associated height. The supported IBC clients are: Solo Machine light client: Devices such as phones, browsers, or laptops. Tendermint light client: The default for Cosmos SDK-based chains. Wasm client: Proxy client useful for running light clients written in a Wasm-compilable language. Localhost (loopback) client: Useful for testing, simulation, and relaying packets to modules on the same application.","s":"Clients","u":"/v10/ibc/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/overview/#clients","p":2013},{"i":2021,"t":"IBC Client Heights are represented by the struct: type Height struct { RevisionNumber uint64 RevisionHeight uint64 } The RevisionNumber represents the revision of the chain that the height is representing. A revision typically represents a continuous, monotonically increasing range of block-heights. The RevisionHeight represents the height of the chain within the given revision. On any reset of the RevisionHeight—for example, when hard-forking a Tendermint chain, the RevisionNumber will get incremented. This allows IBC clients to distinguish between a block height n of a previous revision of the chain (at revision p) and block-height n of the current revision of the chain (at revision e). Heights that share the same revision number can be compared by simply comparing their respective RevisionHeights. Heights that do not share the same revision number will only be compared using their respective RevisionNumbers. Thus a height h with revision number e+1 will always be greater than a height g with revision number e, REGARDLESS of the difference in revision heights. For example: Height{RevisionNumber: 3, RevisionHeight: 0} > Height{RevisionNumber: 2, RevisionHeight: 100000000000} When a Tendermint chain is running a particular revision, relayers can simply submit headers and proofs with the revision number given by the chain's chainID, and the revision height given by the Tendermint block height. When a chain updates using a hard-fork and resets its block-height, it is responsible for updating its chainID to increment the revision number. IBC Tendermint clients then verifies the revision number against their chainID and treat the RevisionHeight as the Tendermint block-height. Tendermint chains wishing to use revisions to maintain persistent IBC connections even across height-resetting upgrades must format their chainIDs in the following manner: {chainID}-{revision_number}. On any height-resetting upgrade, the chainID MUST be updated with a higher revision number than the previous value. For example: Before upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-3 After upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-4 Clients that do not require revisions, such as the 06-solomachine client, can simply hardcode 0 into the revision number whenever they need to return an IBC height when implementing IBC interfaces and use the RevisionHeight exclusively. Other client types can implement their own logic to verify the IBC heights that relayers provide in their Update, Misbehavior, and Verify functions respectively. The IBC interfaces expect an ibcexported.Height interface, however all clients must use the concrete implementation provided in 02-client/types and reproduced above.","s":"IBC client heights","u":"/v10/ibc/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/overview/#ibc-client-heights","p":2013},{"i":2023,"t":"Connections encapsulate two ConnectionEnd objects on two separate blockchains. Each ConnectionEnd is associated with a client of the other blockchain (for example, the counterparty blockchain). The connection handshake is responsible for verifying that the light clients on each chain are correct for their respective counterparties. Connections, once established, are responsible for facilitating all cross-chain verifications of IBC state. A connection can be associated with any number of channels. The connection handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a connection with chain B using already established light clients on both chains: chain A sends a ConnectionOpenInit message to signal a connection initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenTry message to try opening the connection on chain A. chain A sends a ConnectionOpenAck message to mark its connection end state as open. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenConfirm message to mark its connection end state as open. Time delayed connections​ Connections can be opened with a time delay by setting the delay_period field (in nanoseconds) in the MsgConnectionOpenInit. The time delay is used to require that the underlying light clients have been updated to a certain height before commitment verification can be performed. delayPeriod is used in conjunction with the max_expected_time_per_block parameter of the connection submodule to determine the blockDelay, which is number of blocks that the connection must be delayed by. When commitment verification is performed, the connection submodule will pass delayPeriod and blockDelay to the light client. It is up to the light client to determine whether the light client has been updated to the required height.

A relayer process monitors for updates to these paths and relays messages by submitting the data stored under the path and a proof to the counterparty chain.

Each port must be identified by a unique portID. Since IBC is designed to be secure with mutually distrusted modules operating on the same ledger, binding a port returns a dynamic object capability. In order to take action on a particular port (for example, an open channel with its port ID), a module must provide the dynamic object capability to the IBC handler. This requirement prevents a malicious module from opening channels with ports it does not own. Thus, IBC modules are responsible for claiming the capability that is returned on BindPort.","s":"Ports","u":"/v10/ibc/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/overview/#ports","p":2013},{"i":2029,"t":"An IBC channel can be established between two IBC ports. Currently, a port is exclusively owned by a single module. IBC packets are sent over channels. Just as IP packets contain the destination IP address and IP port, and the source IP address and source IP port, IBC packets contain the destination port ID and channel ID, and the source port ID and channel ID. This packet structure enables IBC to correctly route packets to the destination module while allowing modules receiving packets to know the sender module. A channel can be ORDERED, where packets from a sending module must be processed by the receiving module in the order they were sent. Or a channel can be UNORDERED, where packets from a sending module are processed in the order they arrive (might be in a different order than they were sent). Modules can choose which channels they wish to communicate over with, thus IBC expects modules to implement callbacks that are called during the channel handshake. These callbacks can do custom channel initialization logic. If any callback returns an error, the channel handshake fails. Thus, by returning errors on callbacks, modules can programmatically reject and accept channels. The channel handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a channel with chain B using an already established connection: chain A sends a ChanOpenInit message to signal a channel initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ChanOpenTry message to try opening the channel on chain A. chain A sends a ChanOpenAck message to mark its channel end status as open. chain B sends a ChanOpenConfirm message to mark its channel end status as open. If all handshake steps are successful, the channel is opened on both sides. At each step in the handshake, the module associated with the ChannelEnd executes its callback. So on ChanOpenInit, the module on chain A executes its callback OnChanOpenInit. The channel identifier is auto derived in the format: channel-{N} where N is the next sequence to be used. Closing channels​ Closing a channel occurs in 2 handshake steps as defined in ICS 04. Once a channel is closed, it cannot be reopened. The channel handshake steps are: ChanCloseInit closes a channel on the executing chain if the channel exists and it is not already closed, the connection it exists upon is OPEN, the IBC module callback OnChanCloseInit returns nil. ChanCloseInit can be initiated by any user by submitting a MsgChannelCloseInit transaction. Note that channels are automatically closed when a packet times out on an ORDERED channel. A timeout on an ORDERED channel skips the ChanCloseInit step and immediately closes the channel. ChanCloseConfirm is a response to a counterparty channel executing ChanCloseInit. The channel on the executing chain closes if the channel exists and is not already closed, the connection the channel exists upon is OPEN, the executing chain successfully verifies that the counterparty channel has been closed the IBC module callback OnChanCloseConfirm returns nil.

All IBC packets contain the destination portID and channelID along with the source portID and channelID. This packet structure allows modules to know the sender module of a given packet. IBC packets contain a sequence to optionally enforce ordering. IBC packets also contain a TimeoutHeight and a TimeoutTimestamp that determine the deadline before the receiving module must process a packet. Modules send custom application data to each other inside the Data []byte field of the IBC packet. Thus, packet data is opaque to IBC handlers. It is incumbent on a sender module to encode their application-specific packet information into the Data field of packets. The receiver module must decode that Data back to the original application data.","s":"Packets","u":"/v10/ibc/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/overview/#packets","p":2013},{"i":2033,"t":"Since IBC works over a distributed network and relies on potentially faulty relayers to relay messages between ledgers, IBC must handle the case where a packet does not get sent to its destination in a timely manner or at all. Packets must specify a non-zero value for timeout height (TimeoutHeight) or timeout timestamp (TimeoutTimestamp ) after which a packet can no longer be successfully received on the destination chain. The timeoutHeight indicates a consensus height on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer to be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. The timeoutTimestamp indicates a timestamp on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer to be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. If the timeout passes without the packet being successfully received, the packet can no longer be received on the destination chain. The sending module can timeout the packet and take appropriate actions. If the timeout is reached, then a proof of packet timeout can be submitted to the original chain. The original chain can then perform application-specific logic to timeout the packet, perhaps by rolling back the packet send changes (refunding senders any locked funds, etc). In ORDERED channels, a timeout of a single packet in the channel causes the channel to close. If packet sequence n times out, then a packet at sequence k > n cannot be received without violating the contract of ORDERED channels that packets are processed in the order that they are sent. Since ORDERED channels enforce this invariant, a proof that sequence n has not been received on the destination chain by the specified timeout of packet n is sufficient to timeout packet n and close the channel. In UNORDERED channels, the application-specific timeout logic for that packet is applied and the channel is not closed. Packets can be received in any order. IBC writes a packet receipt for each sequence received in the UNORDERED channel. This receipt does not contain information; it is simply a marker intended to signify that the UNORDERED channel has received a packet at the specified sequence. To timeout a packet on an UNORDERED channel, a proof is required that a packet receipt does not exist for the packet's sequence by the specified timeout. For this reason, most modules should use UNORDERED channels as they require fewer liveness guarantees to function effectively for users of that channel.","s":"Receipts and timeouts","u":"/v10/ibc/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/overview/#receipts-and-timeouts","p":2013},{"i":2035,"t":"Modules can also choose to write application-specific acknowledgments upon processing a packet.

This acknowledgment data is opaque to IBC much like the packet Data and is treated by IBC as a simple byte string []byte. Receiver modules must encode their acknowledgment so that the sender module can decode it correctly. The encoding must be negotiated between the two parties during version negotiation in the channel handshake. The acknowledgment can encode whether the packet processing succeeded or failed, along with additional information that allows the sender module to take appropriate action. After the acknowledgment has been written by the receiving chain, a relayer relays the acknowledgment back to the original sender module. The original sender module then executes application-specific acknowledgment logic using the contents of the acknowledgment. After an acknowledgement fails, packet-send changes can be rolled back (for example, refunding senders in ICS 20). After an acknowledgment is received successfully on the original sender on the chain, the corresponding packet commitment is deleted since it is no longer needed.","s":"Acknowledgments","u":"/v10/ibc/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/overview/#acknowledgments","p":2013},{"i":2037,"t":"If you want to learn more about IBC, check the following specifications: IBC specification overview","s":"Further readings and specs","u":"/v10/ibc/overview/","h":"/v10/ibc/overview/#further-readings-and-specs","p":2013},{"i":2039,"t":"Create a custom IBC v2 middleware Implement IBCModule interface WriteAckWrapper Integrate IBC v2 Middleware Security Model Design Principles","s":"Quick Navigation","u":"/v10/ibc/middleware/developIBCv2/","h":"","p":2038},{"i":2041,"t":"IBC middleware will wrap over an underlying IBC application (a base application or downstream middleware) and sits between core IBC and the base application. warning middleware developers must use the same serialization and deserialization method as in ibc-go's codec: transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON For middleware builders this means: import transfertypes \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types\" transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON func MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) { return transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&ack) } The interfaces a middleware must implement are found in core/api.

Thus, when implementing a middleware for a specific purpose, it is recommended to be as unintrusive as possible in the middleware design while still accomplishing the intended behavior. The least intrusive middleware is stateless. They simply read the ICS26 callback arguments before calling the underlying app's callback and error if the arguments are not acceptable (e.g. whitelisting packets). Stateful middleware that are used solely for erroring are also very simple to build, an example of this would be a rate-limiting middleware that prevents transfer outflows from getting too high within a certain time frame. Middleware that directly interfere with the payload or acknowledgement before passing control to the underlying app are way more intrusive to the underlying app processing. This makes such middleware more error-prone when implementing as incorrect handling can cause the underlying app to break or worse execute unexpected behavior. Moreover, such middleware typically needs to be built for a specific underlying app rather than being generic. An example of this is the packet-forwarding middleware which modifies the payload and is specifically built for transfer. Middleware that modifies the payload or acknowledgement such that it is no longer readable by the underlying application is the most complicated middleware. Since it is not readable by the underlying apps, if these middleware write additional state into payloads and acknowledgements that get committed to IBC core provable state, there MUST be an equivalent counterparty middleware that is able to parse and interpret this additional state while also converting the payload and acknowledgment back to a readable form for the underlying application on its side. Thus, such middleware requires deployment on both sides of an IBC connection or the packet processing will break. This is the hardest type of middleware to implement, integrate and deploy.

Middleware accomplishes this by formatting the version in a JSON-encoded string containing the middleware version and the application version. The application version may as well be a JSON-encoded string, possibly including further middleware and app versions, if the application stack consists of multiple milddlewares wrapping a base application. The format of the version is specified in ICS-30 as the following: { \"<middleware_version_key>\": \"<middleware_version_value>\", \"app_version\": \"<application_version_value>\" } The <middleware_version_key> key in the JSON struct should be replaced by the actual name of the key for the corresponding middleware (e.g. fee_version). During the handshake callbacks, the middleware can unmarshal the version string and retrieve the middleware and application versions. It can do its negotiation logic on <middleware_version_value>, and pass the <application_version_value> to the underlying application. NOTE: Middleware that does not need to negotiate with a counterparty middleware on the remote stack will not implement the version unmarshalling and negotiation, and will simply perform its own custom logic on the callbacks without relying on the counterparty behaving similarly.

The current IBC protocol supports upgrading tendermint chains for a specific subset of IBC-client-breaking upgrades. Here is the exhaustive list of IBC client-breaking upgrades and whether the IBC protocol currently supports such upgrades. IBC currently does NOT support unplanned upgrades. All of the following upgrades must be planned and committed to in advance by the upgrading chain, in order for counterparty clients to maintain their connections securely. Note: Since upgrades are only implemented for Tendermint clients, this doc only discusses upgrades on Tendermint chains that would break counterparty IBC Tendermint Clients. Changing the Chain-ID: Supported Changing the UnbondingPeriod: Partially Supported, chains may increase the unbonding period with no issues. However, decreasing the unbonding period may irreversibly break some counterparty clients. Thus, it is not recommended that chains reduce the unbonding period. Changing the height (resetting to 0): Supported, so long as chains remember to increment the revision number in their chain-id. Changing the ProofSpecs: Supported, this should be changed if the proof structure needed to verify IBC proofs is changed across the upgrade. Ex: Switching from an IAVL store, to a SimpleTree Store Changing the UpgradePath: Supported, this might involve changing the key under which upgraded clients and consensus states are stored in the upgrade store, or even migrating the upgrade store itself. Migrating the IBC store: Unsupported, as the IBC store location is negotiated by the connection. Upgrading to a backwards compatible version of IBC: Supported Upgrading to a non-backwards compatible version of IBC: Unsupported, as IBC version is negotiated on connection handshake. Changing the Tendermint LightClient algorithm: Partially Supported. Changes to the light client algorithm that do not change the ClientState or ConsensusState struct may be supported, provided that the counterparty is also upgraded to support the new light client algorithm. Changes that require updating the ClientState and ConsensusState structs themselves are theoretically possible by providing a path to translate an older ClientState struct into the new ClientState struct; however this is not currently implemented.","s":"IBC Client Breaking Upgrades","u":"/v10/ibc/upgrades/quick-guide/","h":"/v10/ibc/upgrades/quick-guide/#ibc-client-breaking-upgrades","p":2149},{"i":2154,"t":"If the IBC-connected chain is conducting an upgrade that will break counterparty clients, it must ensure that the upgrade is first supported by IBC using the list above and then execute the upgrade process described below in order to prevent counterparty clients from breaking.

Thus, the upgrade process for relayers trying to upgrade the counterparty clients is as follows: Wait for the upgrading chain to reach the upgrade height and halt Query a full node for the proofs of UpgradedClient and UpgradedConsensusState at the last height of the old chain. Update the counterparty client to the last height of the old chain using the UpdateClient msg. Submit an UpgradeClient msg to the counterparty chain with the UpgradedClient, UpgradedConsensusState and their respective proofs.

The Tendermint client on the counterparty chain will verify that the upgrading chain did indeed commit to the upgraded client and upgraded consensus state at the upgrade height (since the upgrade height is included in the key). If the proofs are verified against the upgrade height, then the client will upgrade to the new client while retaining all of its client-customized fields. Thus, it will retain its old TrustingPeriod, TrustLevel, MaxClockDrift, etc; while adopting the new chain-specified fields such as UnbondingPeriod, ChainId, UpgradePath, etc. Note, this can lead to an invalid client since the old client-chosen fields may no longer be valid given the new chain-chosen fields. Upgrading chains should try to avoid these situations by not altering parameters that can break old clients. For an example, see the UnbondingPeriod example in the supported upgrades section. The upgraded consensus state will serve purely as a basis of trust for future UpdateClientMsgs and will not contain a consensus root to perform proof verification against. Thus, relayers must submit an UpdateClientMsg with a header from the new chain so that the connection can be used for proof verification again.","s":"Step-by-Step Upgrade Process for Relayers Upgrading Counterparty Clients","u":"/v10/ibc/upgrades/quick-guide/","h":"/v10/ibc/upgrades/quick-guide/#step-by-step-upgrade-process-for-relayers-upgrading-counterparty-clients","p":2149},{"i":2158,"t":"This section explains how to use the callbacks middleware from the perspective of an IBC Actor.

This allows IBC applications to be built on top of core IBC, and to be able to execute custom logic on packet lifecycle events (e.g. unescrow tokens for ICS-20). This setup worked well for off-chain users interacting with IBC applications. However, we are now seeing the desire for secondary applications (e.g. smart contracts, modules) to call into IBC apps as part of their state machine logic and then do some actions on packet lifecycle events. The Callbacks Middleware allows for this functionality by allowing the packets of the underlying IBC applications to register callbacks to secondary applications for lifecycle events. These callbacks are then executed by the Callbacks Middleware when the corresponding packet lifecycle event occurs. After much discussion, the design was expanded to an ADR, and the Callbacks Middleware is an implementation of that ADR.","s":"What is the Callbacks Middleware?","u":"/v10/middleware/callbacks/overview/","h":"/v10/middleware/callbacks/overview/#what-is-the-callbacks-middleware","p":2224},{"i":2229,"t":"Callbacks Middleware was built with smart contracts in mind, but can be used by any secondary application that wants to allow IBC packets to call into it. Think of the Callbacks Middleware as a bridge between core IBC and a secondary application. We have the following definitions: Underlying IBC application: The IBC application that is wrapped by the Callbacks Middleware. This is the IBC application that is actually sending and receiving packet lifecycle events from core IBC. For example, the transfer module, or the ICA controller submodule. IBC Actor: IBC Actor is an on-chain or off-chain entity that can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application. For example, a smart contract, an off-chain user, or a module that sends a transfer packet are all IBC Actors. Secondary application: The application that is being called into by the Callbacks Middleware for packet lifecycle events. This is the application that is receiving the callback directly from the Callbacks Middleware module. For example, the x/wasm module. Callback Actor: The on-chain smart contract or module that is registered to receive callbacks from the secondary application. For example, a Wasm smart contract (gatekeeped by the x/wasm module). Note that the Callback Actor is not necessarily the same as the IBC Actor. For example, an off-chain user can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application, but the Callback Actor could be a smart contract. The secondary application may want to check that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor, for example, by checking that the IBC Actor is the same as the Callback Actor. Callback Address: Address of the Callback Actor. This is the address that the secondary application will call into when a packet lifecycle event occurs. For example, the address of the Wasm smart contract. Maximum gas limit: The maximum amount of gas that the Callbacks Middleware will allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. User defined gas limit: The amount of gas that the IBC Actor wants to allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. This is the gas limit that the IBC Actor specifies when it sends a packet to the underlying IBC application. This cannot be greater than the maximum gas limit. Think of the secondary application as a bridge between the Callbacks Middleware and the Callback Actor. The secondary application is responsible for executing the custom logic of the Callback Actor when a packet lifecycle event occurs. The secondary application is also responsible for checking that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor. Note that it is possible that the IBC Actor, Secondary Application, and Callback Actor are all the same entity. In which case, the Callback Address should be the secondary application's module address.

Maximum gas limit is hardcoded manually during wiring. It requires a coordinated upgrade to change the maximum gas limit. The receive packet callback does not pass the relayer address to the secondary application. This is so that we can use the same callback for both synchronous and asynchronous acknowledgements. The receive packet callback does not pass IBC Actor's address, this is because the IBC Actor lives in the counterparty chain and cannot be trusted.","s":"Known Limitations","u":"/v10/middleware/callbacks/overview/","h":"/v10/middleware/callbacks/overview/#known-limitations","p":2224},{"i":2233,"t":"This document is intended to highlight significant changes which may require more information than presented in the CHANGELOG.

The Base Application was intended to be composed with the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper and facilitate many forms of message authentication depending on a chain's particular use case. Prior to ibc-go v6 the controller submodule exposed only these two functions (to which we will refer as the legacy APIs): RegisterInterchainAccount SendTx However, these functions have now been deprecated in favour of the new controller submodule MsgServer and will be removed in later releases. Both APIs remain functional and maintain backwards compatibility in ibc-go v6, however consumers of these APIs are now recommended to follow the message passing paradigm outlined in Cosmos SDK ADR 031 and ADR 033. This is facilitated by the Cosmos SDK MsgServiceRouter and chain developers creating custom application logic can now omit the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper from their module and instead depend on message routing. Depending on the use case, developers of custom authentication modules face one of three scenarios: My authentication module needs to access IBC packet callbacks Application developers that wish to consume IBC packet callbacks and react upon packet acknowledgements must continue using the controller submodule's legacy APIs. The authentication modules will not need a ScopedKeeper anymore, though, because the channel capability will be claimed by the controller submodule. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the authentication module's ScopedKeeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) is not needed anymore and can be removed for the argument list of the keeper constructor function, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, ) Please note that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Therefore the authentication module's ScopedKeeper cannot be completely removed from the chain code until the migration has run. In the future, the use of the legacy APIs for accessing packet callbacks will be replaced by IBC Actor Callbacks (see ADR 008 for more details) and it will also be possible to access them with the MsgServiceRouter. My authentication module does not need access to IBC packet callbacks The authentication module can migrate from using the legacy APIs and it can be composed instead with the MsgServiceRouter, so that the authentication module is able to pass messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer to register interchain accounts and send packets to the interchain account. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the ICS27 controller submodule keeper (ICAControllerKeeper) and authentication module scoped keeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) are not needed anymore and can be replaced with the MsgServiceRouter, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], - app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, + app.MsgServiceRouter(), ) In your authentication module you can route messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer instead of using the legacy APIs. For example, for registering an interchain account: - if err := keeper.icaControllerKeeper.RegisterInterchainAccount( - ctx, - connectionID, - owner.String(), - version, - ); err != nil { - return err - } + msg := controllertypes.NewMsgRegisterInterchainAccount( + connectionID, + owner.String(), + version, + ) + handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) + res, err := handler(ctx, msg) + if err != nil { + return err + } where controllertypes is an import alias for \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v6/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/controller/types\". In addition, in this use case the authentication module does not need to implement the IBCModule interface anymore. I do not need a custom authentication module anymore If your authentication module does not have any extra functionality compared to the default authentication module added in ibc-go v6 (the MsgServer), or if you can use a generic authentication module, such as the x/auth, x/gov or x/group modules from the Cosmos SDK (v0.46 and later), then you can remove your authentication module completely and use instead the gRPC endpoints of the MsgServer or the CLI added in ibc-go v6. Please remember that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Host params​ The ICS27 host submodule default params have been updated to include the AllowAllHostMsgs wildcard *. This enables execution of any sdk.Msg type for ICS27 registered on the host chain InterfaceRegistry. // AllowAllHostMsgs holds the string key that allows all message types on interchain accounts host module const AllowAllHostMsgs = \"*\" ... // DefaultParams is the default parameter configuration for the host submodule func DefaultParams() Params { - return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, nil) + return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, []string{AllowAllHostMsgs}) } API breaking changes​ SerializeCosmosTx takes in a []proto.Message instead of []sdk.Message. This allows for the serialization of proto messages without requiring the fulfillment of the sdk.Msg interface. The 27-interchain-accounts genesis types have been moved to their own package: modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/genesis/types. This change facilitates the addition of the ICS27 controller submodule MsgServer and avoids cyclic imports. This should have minimal disruption to chain developers integrating 27-interchain-accounts. The ICS27 host submodule NewKeeper function in modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/host/keeper now includes an additional parameter of type ICS4Wrapper. This provides the host submodule with the ability to correctly unwrap channel versions in the event of a channel reopening handshake. func NewKeeper( cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, paramSpace paramtypes.Subspace, - channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper, + ics4Wrapper icatypes.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper, accountKeeper icatypes.AccountKeeper, scopedKeeper icatypes.ScopedKeeper, msgRouter icatypes.MessageRouter, ) Keeper","s":"ICS27 - Interchain Accounts","u":"/v10/migrations/v5-to-v6/","h":"/v10/migrations/v5-to-v6/#ics27---interchain-accounts","p":2301},{"i":2311,"t":"The NewKeeper function of ICS29 has been updated to remove the paramSpace parameter as it was unused. func NewKeeper( - cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, paramSpace paramtypes.Subspace, - ics4Wrapper types.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper types.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper types.PortKeeper, authKeeper types.AccountKeeper, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper, + cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, + ics4Wrapper types.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper types.ChannelKeeper, + portKeeper types.PortKeeper, authKeeper types.AccountKeeper, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper, ) Keeper {","s":"ICS29 - NewKeeper API change","u":"/v10/migrations/v5-to-v6/","h":"/v10/migrations/v5-to-v6/#ics29---newkeeper-api-change","p":2301},{"i":2313,"t":"The SendTransfer function of ICS20 has been removed.

The Initialize method is now expected to set the initial client state, consensus state and any client-specific metadata in the provided store upon client creation. The CheckHeaderAndUpdateState method has been split into 4 new methods: VerifyClientMessage verifies a ClientMessage. A ClientMessage could be a Header, Misbehaviour, or batch update. Calls to CheckForMisbehaviour, UpdateState, and UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour will assume that the content of the ClientMessage has been verified and can be trusted. An error should be returned if the ClientMessage fails to verify. CheckForMisbehaviour checks for evidence of a misbehaviour in Header or Misbehaviour types. UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour performs appropriate state changes on a ClientState given that misbehaviour has been detected and verified. UpdateState updates and stores as necessary any associated information for an IBC client, such as the ClientState and corresponding ConsensusState. An error is returned if ClientMessage is of type Misbehaviour. Upon successful update, a list containing the updated consensus state height is returned. The CheckMisbehaviourAndUpdateState function has been removed from ClientState interface. This functionality is now encapsulated by the usage of VerifyClientMessage, CheckForMisbehaviour, UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour. The function GetTimestampAtHeight has been added to the ClientState interface. It should return the timestamp for a consensus state associated with the provided height. Prior to ibc-go/v7 the ClientState interface defined a method for each data type which was being verified in the counterparty state store. The state verification functions for all IBC data types have been consolidated into two generic methods, VerifyMembership and VerifyNonMembership. Both are expected to be provided with a standardised key path, exported.Path, as defined in ICS 24 host requirements. Membership verification requires callers to provide the marshalled value []byte. Delay period values should be zero for non-packet processing verification. A zero proof height is now allowed by core IBC and may be passed into VerifyMembership and VerifyNonMembership. Light clients are responsible for returning an error if a zero proof height is invalid behaviour.
